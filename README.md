# Linear-Regression-Single variable

Prediction of  home prices can be done using linear regression.
We will train the data that has home areas their corresponding prices and train a linear regression model using sklearn linear regression class.
After that we will use  predict method  on linear regression object to make actual forecast. 

First of all we will Import data in dataframe .
After that we will Import sklearn library.
Then we will Plot  the scatter plot.
At last we will Create Linear Regression object.


We will be importing numpy, pandas, matplotlib.
